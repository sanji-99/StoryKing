### 2. ElevenLabs API Key

To get your ElevenLabs API key:

1. Visit [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) and create an account
2. Go to your profile settings → API Key
3. Generate a new API key
4. Replace `YOUR_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` in `lib/screens/main_screen.dart` with your actual API key

### API Keys Implementation Locations

- DeepSeek API Key: `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`
- ElevenLabs API Key: `lib/screens/main_screen.dart`

### Adjusting Token Settings

You can increase the tokens used for story generation in:
`lib/services/story_service.dart` (around line 176)
Change: `'max_tokens': 300,` to your preferred value

## Internship Work Overview

During my internship, I focused on the following areas:

- Frontend UI/UX development
- API integration (Elevenlabs TTS, Deepseek Story Service)
- State management
- App architecture and component design

## Project Directory Guide

This guide will help you understand the parts of the project I worked on.

### Main App Structure

- `lib/main.dart`: The entry point of the application with theme management and app initialization.

### UI Screens (lib/screens/)

These files contain the screens I developed:

- `main_screen.dart`: The main app interface with navigation. Contains the Elevenlabs TTS API integration.
- `home_screen.dart`: The landing screen with story generation UI. Contains Deepseek API integration.
- `profile_screen.dart`: User profile UI with settings management.

### API Services (lib/services/)

I implemented these service files for API integration:

- `tts_service.dart`: Text-to-speech functionality using Elevenlabs API.
- `story_service.dart`: Story generation using Deepseek API.
- `storage_service.dart`: Local data persistence.

### Data Models (lib/models/)

These define the data structures I designed:

- `story.dart`: Story data model for managing generated content.
- `user_model.dart`: User data structure.
